I have created a database management system for a library.The program depicts the working of a library. This program will help the user to manage the records of a library.
Much of the functioning of a library could be automated using the available technologies. Instead of dealing with files (papers) the use of a good Database program would not only reduce the operating cost but also make the task of the Librarian easier. The most important thing is that a program of this sort can provide good service to the user.

Aim of the project is to develop software which would automate the functioning of a library.
Overview:
Features-
Maintaining the catalogue of the books and periodicals available in the library.
Keeping track of issue and return of books.

Presenting the up-to-date status to the librarian.
